My first web project. Started as an academic project, ended up being expanded and made available to the university community.

Full-stack development: Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, HTML+CSS+Bootstrap, Amazon S3, Heroku, Github.

I’ve done most of designing, development and planning. It was super satisfying to see it being used and being appreciated for its ease of use and pleasing design. The hard work resulted in more than 27,000 pageviews and 5500 unique users.
